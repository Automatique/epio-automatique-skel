This is basically a clone of epio-skel (https://github.com/idangazit/epio_skel/) but with some extra tweaks:

* added redis based sessions and celery
* you start out with a homepage, 404 and HTML5 boilerplate
* better, i think, defaults in epio.ini
* and more minor tweaks...

I like these defaults. Bu this might not be best for your project, just sayin'
